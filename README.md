# Train-Scheduler

Read in station data/train data and provide features for data retrieval between two nodes. This project helped solidify my understanding of linked lists and structs.

# Details

The program will read in two text files, a stations list and a trains list. The stations file will provide two data items per line, a station ID and a station name. The trains file will include fours data items per line: the departing station id, the arrival station id, departure time, and arrival time. Note the times are in total minutes format.

# Usage

Compile and use the following syntax:
```
./a.out <stationFile> <trainFile>
```
